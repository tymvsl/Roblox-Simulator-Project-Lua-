More people, more Advancment! Help me to create a Roblox Simulator game with lua scripting toogether!

Hey People! Here's my game Idea:

I waant to create a Game that has a lots of swords (Better Sword, Lower Cooldown and More Damage). The simulator has Auras for the Sword (that upgrade its Power). And the Game also has a Sword Equipment (It can not be obtained for Coins, it gets obtained by Gems).
Also, the Sword Equipment ALWAYS upgrades the Sword Abilities.

For now, that's all I wanted to add. I would be happy, if you guys can share some Scripts with me for a Simulator game, as I am not a Simulator Scripter!
